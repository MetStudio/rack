/// Variable-like that is linked to a standard variable: double, int, std::string . Supports multi-element arrays through drain::UniTuple
/**

drain::Reference does not have memory of its own. The type of reference cannot be changed â€“ it is that of the referenced variable.

The only character string type supported is \c std::string .

Currently, the only multi-element structure supported is drain::UniTuple<>, which has a fixed start address for its elements.
In future, STL Sequences like std::vectors may be supported.

Reference does not support STL containers.

This class is best illustrated together with its counterparts supporting own memory, Variable and FlexibleVariable
