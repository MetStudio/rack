	 *   -# The reflectivity is typically high, over 30 dBZ

	 *   -# The height of a convective cell typically reaches at least 5km

	 *  -# \f$ zCell \f$ : minimum reflectivity of convective area and its top
	 *  -# \f$ cellHeight \f$ : minimum top height of a convective cell (having reflectivity > \f$ zCell \f$)

	 *   - \f$ f_{\mathrm{echoTop}}\f$ : echo top for \f$z\f$ ; a fuzzy threshold at location \f$h\f$ (minimum height) and steepness \f$ z_w \f$
